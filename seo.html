    <h2>SEO Strategies</h2>
    <p>Keyword research is a technique used for on-page SEO. It involves finding relevant keywords that users frequently search for and strategically integrating them into website content to enhance search engine visibility and relevance (Duggal, 2024). Effective keyword research helps create content that engages audience members and ranks well on search engines by targeting the right search terms. Knowing how search engines evaluate content based on expertise, authority, and trust (EAT) makes it easier to choose relevant keywords that match users' needs. Using long-tail keywords in URLs, image alt tags, and throughout your content can boost your SEO, bringing in more targeted traffic (310 Creative, 2024).</p>

    <p>Optimizing on-page elements is a second technique that involves titles, meta descriptions, header tags, and images. This is key to improving both search rankings and user experience. A well-crafted title tag with relevant keywords helps the page rank higher as well as encouraging users to click on it. Meta descriptions don’t directly impact rankings, but a concise and engaging summary can significantly boost click-through rates. Header tags assist with structuring content, making it easier for search engines to understand the page and improving readability for visitors. Optimizing images by compressing them, using descriptive file names, and adding keyword-rich alt text improves site speed and performance. These practices altogether enhance a website’s visibility and drive more organic traffic (310 Creative, 2024).</p>

    <p>High-quality backlinks are essential for boosting a website's authority and search rankings. It is a type of Off-Page SEO strategy to enhance the website's authority, credibility, and relevance in the eyes of search engines, leading to higher rankings and increased organic traffic (Duggal, 2024). Techniques like guest blogging allow the contribution of valuable content to reputable sites, building authority and increasing traffic. The skyscraper technique involves creating content that surpasses existing high-performing articles, helps earn quality backlinks and increases visibility. Broken link building focuses on replacing broken links on relevant sites with content, securing backlinks and improving SEO (310 Creative, 2024).</p>
